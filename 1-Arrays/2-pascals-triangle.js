/**
 * 
Program to generate Pascal’s Triangle
Problem Statement: Given an integer N, return the first N rows of Pascal’s triangle.

In Pascal’s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown in the figure below: 

Input Format: N = 5

Result:
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1






Explanation: There are 5 rows in the output matrix. Each row corresponds to each one of the rows in the image shown above.
